# TheRealFredPD - Github Readme

Hi! I'm Frederick Pellerin, a tech enthusiast from Quebec City, Canada. My current passion lies in cybersecurity, ethical hacking, AI, and coding. With a lifelong commitment to self-education, I've immersed myself in hands-on learning experiences from the moment I discovered the vast spectrum of online hacking classes available.

You can usually find me grinding into challenges on learning platforms like Tryhackme, Hackthebox, and pwn.college, pursuing that next flag. I'm also enrolled in multiple ongoing courses on AWS Skills, Microsoft Learn, Cybrary, and Sololearn, seeking to expand my skill set and knowledge base.

Beyond the realms of tech, I dabble in AI art generation, and I'd love for you to check out some of my creations on my Nightcafe.Studio profile: [[FredP3D Profile @ Nightcafe.Studio](https://creator.nightcafe.studio/u/Fredp3d).]
(I use and try a lot of AI platforms these days. My creations, the shareable ones, are posted on my Twitter.  No Instagram in my case.)

Feel free to reach out to me on Twitter at @TheRealFREDP3D.

À bientôt!

### Rediscovering My Passion: A Journey from Childhood Obsession to Cybersecurity

As a kid, I was drawn to the world of computers like a moth to a flame. The day my father brought home an IBM Clone 386 running MS-DOS was the day my fascination ignited. I was just 7-8 years old then, and those early interactions with the command line, mastering the "cd" and "dir" commands, felt like deciphering arcane spells.

By the time I hit 13, I had already ventured into creating websites. My most ambitious project was a shrine to the iconic PC game, Diablo. In a time when resources were scarce, armed only with Windows Notepad, I crafted a multi-framed website boasting interactive drop-down menus, animated GIFs, and a symphony of music and sounds.

On the pages of "JavaScript 1.1 For Dummies," I found the tools to dive into JavaScript, unknowingly sowing the seeds of a future in IT. But life took me on a detour, my passion faded, and I found myself drifting away.

Recently, I unearthed the remnants of that zeal buried in a box of 3 1/4'' Floppy disks. It was a moment of reconnection, a resurgence of the fire that once burned within. HTML, that old companion, hadn't forgotten me, and I hadn't forgotten it either. It was like reuniting with an old friend after years apart.

These days, GitHub is my playground for exploring IT and cybersecurity. The repositories I fork aren't just collections of code; they're bookmarks of my journey. My journey isn't about accumulating XP points but about unravelling the intricacies of this digital realm.

For the past year, I've been engrossed in HackTheBox Academy and TryHackMe. Markdown has become my muse as I've filled over 1500 pages with meticulous notes, constructing a digital vault of my discoveries in the cybersecurity realm.

A new fascination has stirred within me - static site generators and GitPages. The idea of crafting my corner of the web, a testament to my journey, has taken hold. A personal website feels like the next logical chapter in my ongoing saga.

And so, the embers of my youthful curiosity have reignited into a blazing passion. As I stand at the crossroads of my warehouse career and the beckoning horizon of IT, I'm compelled to chronicle my transformation. It's a tale of navigating through the bewildering maze of cyberspace, learning to decode the matrix, and eventually emerging as a guide for those who are treading the path I once ventured.

Join me in revisiting the trials of TryHackMe and the enigmas of HackTheBox Academy. Together, let's unravel the mysteries and shine a light on the complexities, making the journey smoother for those who come after.

#### Tasks to Complete Before Launching My Website

[X] I need to sort through my notes and separate them from the content I clipped from websites and books. This will ensure that all the information on my website is going to be accurate and relevant and also ensure that I'm the actual author.  ==2023-04-29 == I started this week with over 1200 notes in my Obsidian Vault.  I cut it to 795!  And I did a complete reconstruction of my folder system.  **CHECK!**

[] I also need to learn how to use a static site generator like Jekyll, Hugo, or 11th. This will allow me to easily create and maintain my website without having to write complex code from scratch.

[X] ***(Work in progress)*** The fact that English is not my natural language, I need to write regularly to improve my grammar and communication skills. I've been using Grammarly to help me with this, and I plan to continue writing regularly to maintain my progress.  

[X] Publish on Medium.com - **It's done.** I published a text about how I ended up deeply needing to change my professional path and how a 38-year-old warehouse manager choose without hesitation IT and Cybersecurity as a dream life.  I also published a write-up for the [Tryhackme room: Brute-It](https://tryhackme.com/room/bruteit).

[] To ensure that my website provides valuable content, I plan to revisit every TryHackMe room and HTB Academy module I completed. Now that I have accumulated some experience,  I can share my notes, additional resources, and alternative tools, or at least share my journey (Win&Fails).
***3-11-2023 - Update: Tryhackme updated some of their learning paths. So far I have finished the Burp Suite series.***

[] In addition to improving my technical skills, I plan to obtain my AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Certification. I'm also getting (ISC)2 - Certified Cybersecurity.  
***3-11-2023 - Update:*** I've almost completed the ISC2 CC course but my free subscription isn't valid anymore. Don't plan to return to it because I feel that I learn most of the content of this course.

[] Finally, I will keep training on HackTheBox Academy and TryHackMe and I will try to upscale my online presence and grow my network.
