<div align="justify">Hi, I’m Frederick Pellerin, a tech enthusiast from Quebec City, Canada. My journey with computers began at 6 years old when I first touched a keyboard. By 19, I was tinkering with technology as a hobbyist, but it wasn’t until I was 37 that I rediscovered my passion through Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges.  

Diving into cybersecurity rekindled my interest in programming, which then led me to explore artificial intelligence and large language models. With a lifelong commitment to self-education, I've immersed myself in these subjects combining hands-on learning experiences.  

Now that I’ve found where my true interests lie, studying is fun and satisfying. I can’t get enough of it.  

Feel free to look around or check out my latest projects!

À bientôt!

> Always learning.  
> Always exploring.  
> Join me on the journey!

For several months now, I've dedicated most of my spare time to self-education and hands-on training in fields like networking, AI, software development, and cybersecurity. I especially enjoy participating in Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges, which push my skills to the next level.

## Learning Philosophy

I’m a lifelong *self-learner*. My approach is straightforward:

**Small Study Sessions**: Consistent, bite-sized learning to absorb concepts effectively.

**Practical Application**: Turning theory into practice by creating small personal projects.

This method keeps me engaged, and I’ve been enjoying building and experimenting!

[BanditGUI](https://github.com/therealfredp3d/BanditGUI): A GUI tool to help players complete the Bandit challenges on Overthewire.

**New Experiments**: Small projects to explore networking protocols, AI implementations, and automation scripts.

**Personal Website**: A dedicated space to document my journey, share insights, and showcase my projects (coming soon).

## Tasks to Complete Before Launching My Website

[X] I need to sort through my notes and separate them from the content I clipped from websites and books. This will ensure that all the information on my website is going to be accurate and relevant and also ensure that I'm the actual author.

[ ] I need to learn how to use a static site generator like Jekyll, Hugo, or 11th. This will allow me to easily create and maintain a website without too much energy, reusing my notes.

[ ] - **(Work in progress)** The fact that English is not my natural language, I need to write regularly to improve my grammar and communication skills. I've been using Grammarly to help me with this, and I plan to continue writing regularly to maintain my progress.  

[X] - **Publish on Medium.com**

  I published a text about how I ended up deeply needing to change my professional path and how a 38-year-old warehouse manager chose without hesitation IT and Cybersecurity as a dream life.  

- I published a write-up for Tryhackme's room: [Brute-It](https://tryhackme.com/room/bruteit).

## Latest Focus

- Python training is going fine at a steady pace. I'm about to finish the material to take the **PCEP - Python for Entry-Level Programmer** exam. I don't intend to but the course is great.  
  
- I have been experimenting with AI lately. I finished some courses from Google and Microsoft. I am since experimenting with anything AI related that I can put my hands on.  

- I still train on Hackthebox and some platforms almost daily, but my interest in AI possibilities is growing at a rapid pace. I think AI might overthrow my focus on cybersecurity soon, we'll see...
